final result: passed

Scope: Advanced owner user-management and rights matrix on `/permissions`.

Reference: User Management screenshots with left user list, User Definition/User Rights tabs, dense permission grid, copy-from role, and lock controls.

Verification:
- Existing Aura shell and `/permissions` route preserved.
- Owner user list, advanced filters, User Definition tab, User Rights tab, and audit tab render.
- Permission grid includes menu item plus Access/Add/Edit/Delete/Back/Print/Export/All columns.
- Owner/admin roles keep full control: checks are selected and disabled, and Save rights is disabled.
- `/api/security/user-management` returns live users, role metrics, resources, sessions, and activity.
- No horizontal overflow at 1280px viewport during browser QA.

Remaining polish:
- More seeded non-owner users would make the demo matrix look fuller by default.
